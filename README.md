GenV is a logistics and delivery company that both flies autonomous vehicles and operates a full-fledged logistics system. It runs operations out of our distribution centers, which are called "nests." At a given nest, there is an inventory of medical supplies and a team of operators who manage that inventory and process orders from doctors.
